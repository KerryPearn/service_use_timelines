abstract = {The impact of specialist psychosocial treatment on health service use costs by patients with personality disorder is not yet sufficiently documented. In this prospective study we compare patterns of health service costs by three groups of people with personality disorder treated in a hospital-based program (IPP), a step down program (SDP), and a general psychiatric program (GPP). Total service use costs at follow up, compared with intake costs, showed that significantly higher savings were achieved by SDP and IIP compared with GPP. Cost reductions in SDP were significantly greater than in IPP. Significant cost reductions were found between treatment programs in social worker and community psychiatric nursing and psychotherapy. The cost-effectiveness of the two specialist treatment programs was indicated by the significant association between total cost reduction and clinical outcome in GPP and IPP, but not in GPP. The effect of Major Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder on health service use alone and in combination was also investigated. The finding that Major Depression was found to be more significantly associated with higher health service use costs than Borderline Personality Disorder is discussed.},

abstract = {Aims and method We aimed to evaluate the availability and nature of services for people affected by personality disorder in England by conducting a survey of English National Health Service (NHS) mental health trusts and independent organisations. Results In England, 84{\%} of organisations reported having at least one dedicated personality disorder service. This represents a fivefold increase compared with a 2002 survey. However, only 55{\%} of organisations reported that patients had equal access across localities to these dedicated services. Dedicated services commonly had good levels of service use and carer involvement, and engagement in education, research and training. However, a wider multidisciplinary team and a greater number of biopsychosocial interventions were available through generic services. Clinical implications There has been a substantial increase in service provision for people affected by personality disorder, but continued variability in the availability of services is apparent and it remains unclear whether quality of care has improved.},

abstract = {Aims: There have been recent policy developments and research into care provision for service users with personality disorder. However, few studies have focused on service user and staff perspectives on how services could be improved. Methods: A qualitative study was undertaken in the UK between 2016 and 2017. We conducted six focus groups with clinicians in mental health services with experience of working with people with personality disorder. Using an online survey, we asked current and past service users with personality disorder to describe their experiences of mental health services and make recommendations for improvements. A thematic analysis was conducted. Results: Forty-five clinicians participated in the focus group and 131 service users contributed to the online survey. The main areas of concern identified by both staff and patients were the diagnosis of personality disorder, the absence of a coherent care pathway, access to psychological treatment and staff training. Conclusions: The care pathway for individuals with personality disorder is unclear to clinicians and service users, and elements of the pathway are disjointed and not working as effectively as they could. Guidelines recommended by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are not being followed. Specialist psychological interventions should be available to ensure consistent and stable care provision. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The detection of temporal relationships among time-ordered patient data is an important, but difficult, clinical task. Large volumes of computer-stored clinical data offer the possibility of aiding in the early detection of subtle trends and states, but the presence of irrelevant data can obscure relevant findings and relationships. We present a formal system for representing complex temporal data as events on an abstract entity called a time line. We define five time line operations, SLICE, FILTER, OVERLAY, NEW, and ADD. For each operation, we precisely define the operator's effect on a time line, including exceptions and boundary conditions. In addition to our time line formalism, we describe an interactive environment designed specifically to help humans visualize temporal data. We have developed a database kernel and a graphical user interface that used our time line formalism and operations to support temporal manipulations. Using our formal system and our visualization environment, we describe two issues in the display and manipulation of temporal data: 1. 1. the temporal granularity problem, and 2. 2. the calendar mapping problem. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Background: The increasing complexity and volume of clinical data poses a challenge in the decision-making process. Data visualizations can assist in this process by speeding up the time required to analyze and understand clinical data. Even though empirical experiments show that visualizations facilitate clinical data understanding, a consistent method to assess their effectiveness is still missing. Methods: The insight-based methodology determines the quality of insights a user acquires from the visualization. Insights receive a value from one to five points based on a domain-specific criteria. Five professional psychiatrists took part in the study using real de-identified clinical data spanning 4 years of medical history. Results: A total of 50 assessments were transcribed and analyzed. Comparing a total of 558 insights using Health Timeline and 576 without, the mean value using the Timeline (1.7) was higher than without (1.26; p{\textless}0.01), similarly the cumulative value with the Timeline (11.87) was higher than without (10.96: p{\textless}0.01). The average time required to formulate the first insight with the Timeline was higher (13.16 s) than without (7 s; p{\textless}0.01). Seven insights achieved the highest possible value using Health Timeline while none were obtained without it. Conclusions: The Health Timeline effectively improved understanding of clinical data and helped participants recognize complex patterns from the data. By applying the insight-based methodology, the effectiveness of the Health Timeline was quantified, documented and demonstrated. As an outcome of this exercise, we propose the use of such methodologies to measure the effectiveness of visualizations that assist the clinical decision-making process.},

The paper describes a specific project to map the experiences of people caring for dementia patients, exploring their interactions with governmental and charitable support organisations, their perception of the services available to them, and other informal methods they employed to cope with the caring role. The findings offer a new way of visualising the complex interrelationships between these organisations, and highlight a number of important issues faced by informal carers. These include a pressing need for clearer, more accessible support pathways, clarification of the role and duties of some support organisations, and the value of intangible forms of assistance such as emotional support. These findings will form the basis for future disruptive design interventions in this area.},

Fifteen patients were treated and 16 patients were kept on a waiting-list quasi-control group. Significant differences at termination of therapy were found between the BAP and control groups for two of three target complaints as shown by the Symptom Check List 90-R and the Social Adjustment Scale. In addition, patients improved further on two of three target complaints from termination to follow-up of 1 to 5 years (mean = 2.6 years).

abstract = {Background: Epidemiological data on personality disorders, comorbidity and associated use of services are essential for health service policy. Aims: To measure the prevalence and correlates of personality disorder in a representative community sample. Method: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II disorders was used to measure personality disorder in 626 persons aged 16-74 years in households in England, Scotland and Wales, in a two-phase survey. Results: The weighted prevalence of personality disorder was 4.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 2.9-6.7). Rates were highest among men, separated and unemployed participants in urban locations. High use of healthcare services was confounded by comorbid mental disorder and substance misuse. Cluster B disorders were associated with early institutional care and criminality. Conclusions: Personality disorder is common in the community, especially in urban areas. Services are normally restricted to symptomatic, help-seeking individuals, but a vulnerable group with cluster B disorders can be identified early, are in care during childhood and enter the criminal justice system when young. This suggests the need for preventive interventions at the public mental health level.

abstract = {Background: My Health Record (MyHR) is Australia's national electronic health record (EHR) system. Poor usability and functionality have resulted in low utility, affecting enrollment and participation rates by both patients and clinicians alike. Similar to apps on mobile phone app stores, innovative third-party applications of MyHR platform data can enhance the usefulness of the platform, but there is a paucity of research into the processes involved in developing third-party applications that integrate and use data from EHR systems. Objective: The research describes the challenges involved in pioneering the development of a patient and clinician Web-based software application for MyHR and insights resulting from this experience. Methods: This research uses a case study approach, investigating the development and implementation of Actionable Intime Insights (AI2), a third-party application for MyHR, which translates Medicare claims records stored in MyHR into a clinically meaningful timeline visualization of health data for both patients and clinicians. This case study identifies the challenges encountered by the Personal Health Informatics team from Flinders University in the MyHR third-party application development environment. Results: The study presents a nuanced understanding of different data types and quality of data in MyHR and the complexities associated with developing secondary-use applications. Regulatory requirements associated with utilization of MyHR data, restrictions on visualizations of data, and processes of testing third-party applications were encountered during the development of the application. Conclusions: This study identified several processes, technical and regulatory barriers which, if addressed, can make MyHR a thriving ecosystem of health applications. It clearly identifies opportunities and considerations for the Australian Digital Health Agency and other national bodies wishing to encourage the development of new and innovative use cases for national EHRs.},
